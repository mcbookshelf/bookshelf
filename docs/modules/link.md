## 🔧 Functions

You can find below all functions available in this module.

---

### Create Link

```{function} #bs.link:create_link_ata

Create a link between the entity executing the function and the entity closest to the execution position.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `as <entities>`**: Child entities that you wish to link to a parent.

  **Execution `at <entity>` or `positioned <x> <y> <z>`**: Use the nearest entity as the parent.

:Outputs:
  **Scores `@s bs.link.r[x,y,z]`**: Relative position to the parent entity.

  **Scores `@s bs.link.l[x,y,z,h,v]`**: Local position and rotation relative to the parent entity.

  **Scores `@s bs.link.to`**: ID of the parent entity to which it is linked.
```

*Example: Link armor stands to the nearest sheep:*

```mcfunction
# Once
execute as @e[type=armor_stand] at @e[type=sheep,limit=1,sort=nearest] run function #bs.link:create_link_ata
```

```{important}
You should generally avoid changing output scores, as they serve as parameters for other link functions. Therefore, it is recommended to exclusively let Bookshelf handle them.

```{admonition} Local Position... 🥶 What's this?
:class: dropdown

Unlike relative coordinates, this reference frame considers the entity's rotation. Therefore, when the parent entity rotates, the child entity rotates around it. For those familiar with Minecraft commands, local coordinates are available through the `^` symbol.
```

(custom-behaviors)=
## 🎓 Custom Behaviors

This module allows you to combine multiple behaviors to create your very own optimized custom one.

---

To create a new behavior, you first need to create a new function tag. The tag must start with `#bs.link:behaviors/setup` and end with `#bs.link:behaviors/apply`. Between those 2 functions you are free to use any behaviors that are provided inside the `#bs.link:behaviors` folder.

*Example: This is how `#bs.link:mirror_x_plane` is implemented inside bookshelf:*

```json
{
  "values": [
    "#bs.link:behaviors/setup",
    "#bs.link:behaviors/reverse_pos_x",
    "#bs.link:behaviors/imitate_pos_y",
    "#bs.link:behaviors/imitate_pos_z",
    "#bs.link:behaviors/reverse_rot_h",
    "#bs.link:behaviors/imitate_rot_v",
    "#bs.link:behaviors/apply"
  ]
}
```

```{include} ../_templates/comments.md

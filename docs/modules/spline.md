```{admonition} Supported Dimensions
:class: warning

These functions support only 1D, 2D, and 3D splines. If you need to handle more dimensions, you can run multiple 1D splines in parallel for each axis or component.
```

```{admonition} Variable Number of Points
:class: tip

All spline functions in this module accept a variable number of points. You are not restricted to using just four or any fixed count. Splines are built by combining multiple curve segments, so you can define as many points as needed.

### Evaluate

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} BÃ©zier

```{function} #bs.spline:evaluate_bezier

Evaluate a BÃ©zier spline composed of one or more segments. Each segment is defined by four consecutive control points, with the last point of a segment reused as the first of the next.

# ðŸ“–&nbsp;Examples

In this section, you'll find a variety of practical examples and use cases for **Bookshelf**. Each example is structured as a mini-tutorial, guiding you through different features and their effective implementation. The code snippets shown on each example page are generated by **Lectern** from the pipeline, meaning that the Markdown (`.md`) files containing the examples are processed and converted into fully functional Minecraft datapacks. This ensures that what you see in the documentation is exactly what gets generated for use in the game.

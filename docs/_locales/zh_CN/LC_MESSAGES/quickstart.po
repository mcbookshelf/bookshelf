"Bookshelf is designed to minimize unintended side effects. However, "
"complications can arise when multiple datapacks utilize the same one. To "
"prevent potential issues, it's always recommended to set inputs prior to "
"executing a function. This holds true even though Bookshelf adheres to a "
"strict policy of preserving inputs. By following this practice, you can "
"ensure smoother operation and prevent unexpected behaviors."

## ðŸ“š Glossary

Here are some of the key terms used throughout the documentation.

:::{list-table}
*   - **Bundle**
    - A collection of modules that are shipped together.
*   - **Feature**
    - Something designed for the final user in order to allow them to perform a task. Most of the time, a feature is a function tag to call instead of the function. A feature can also be a loot table, a structure, a predicate or whatever.
*   - **Module**
    - A group of features that share a common purpose and that are contained in a namespace (i.e. datapack structures).
*   - **`ata` functions**
    - `ata` is for "as to at". These functions takes two different positions as arguments: the one is given through the positional argument (`positioned`, `at`, _etc._), and the other one is given is the executor's position.
*   - **`on_<event>` function macro argument**
    - Used to specify a command that should be executed by the feature when a specific event occurs.
*   - **`run` function macro argument**
    - Used to specify a command that should be executed by the feature, often immediately.
*   - **`with` function macro argument**
    - Used to specify optional arguments.

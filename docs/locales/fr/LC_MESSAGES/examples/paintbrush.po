"This example demonstrates how to create a **paintbrush** in Minecraft "
"using the Bookshelf library. The paintbrush changes a block's material to"
" match the item in the player's hand, while preserving important "
"properties like orientation, waterlogging, and other block states. For "
"instance, if the player holds oak planks, birch stairs will transform "
"into oak stairs."

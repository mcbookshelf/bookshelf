" Bookshelf and/or Gunivers in a message of thanks is always appreciated. "
"Let's keep the open-source world a respectful place ðŸ¤—! Additionally, feel"

"Yes! Bookshelf adheres to constraints that ensure compatibility with most"

"As a library is simply a set of tools that you can call upon, it will not"
" impact CPU performance unless actively used. The CPU impact depends on "
"the functions you invoke and their frequency. The documentation provides "
"warnings and performance tips for functions that may be resource-"
"intensive."

"Minecraft parses the entire datapack upon loading, so the number of files"
" is inconsequential. Instructions are lightweight in memory, allowing for"
" numerous functions without a significant increase in RAM usage. "

"modules you require."

"Bookshelf is compressed into a zip file, making it only a few megabytes "

"directly from the repository."

"This is a reduction of \"as to at\". Several functions require two "
"positions to work (example: retrieve the distance between 2 points) or an"
" entity and a position. To simplify the use, no need to pass 3 scores for"
" each position. You will be able to place an entity on point 1 (if it is "
"useful), then execute the function at point 2 while executing it as the "
"entity on point 1."

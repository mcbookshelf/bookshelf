"In this section, you'll find a variety of practical examples and use "
"cases for **Bookshelf**. Each example is structured as a mini-tutorial, "
"guiding you through different features and their effective "
"implementation. The code snippets shown on each example page are "
"generated by **Lectern** from the pipeline, meaning that the Markdown "
"(`.md`) files containing the examples are processed and converted into "
"fully functional Minecraft datapacks. This ensures that what you see in "
"the documentation is exactly what gets generated for use in the game."

## üí¨ Commenting Code

Bookshelf is a collaborative project designed to be both pedagogical and accessible. This means the code is not only functional but also understandable by developers and curious users alike.

To achieve this, **commenting your code regularly and cleanly** is essential.

- Explain the purpose of each function and its key components.
- Ensure comments are concise but provide enough context for others.
- Update comments when the functionality changes to avoid confusion.

Clear comments contribute to a smoother collaboration and make Bookshelf easier to learn from.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Conservation Principle

Bookshelf follows a conservation principle inspired by Antoine Lavoisier‚Äôs maxim:

```{epigraph}
"Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed"

-- Antoine Lavoisier
```

This principle minimizes interference with scores and other data, aiming to prevent accidental overwrites or unnecessary operations.

### Key Guidelines:

- **Minimize the creation of new scores**. Use existing ones whenever possible.
- **Strictly avoid score deletion**. Instead, repurpose scores or reset their values if necessary.
- **Reduce unnecessary score rewrites**. Only update scores when absolutely required.

Each function should handle inputs responsibly, ensuring that only outputs are altered.

# TODO
- [ ] Change the way to check if a string is inside a list
- [ ] Fix the bug where the tick list is empty after a restart of the world: issue seems to come from the fact that during one tick after a restart, the entity does not exist yet (unloaded chunk?) to the tick function is removed from the list
